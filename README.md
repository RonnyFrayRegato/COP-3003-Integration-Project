Explain the relationship between object-oriented inheritance (code-sharing and overriding) and subtyping (the idea of a subtype being usable in a context that expects the supertype):

Object-oriented inheritance allows the member functions, known as methods, of a base class to be passed to a derived class. The base class shares its methods with its derived classes, allowing for the sharing and reusing of code among the classes. The changing of the behaviors of methods among derived classes of a base class is known as overriding. Programmers can implement functions that expect a base class as an argument. Since derived classes are also considered to be of their base type, derived classes may be passed in places expecting their base type. If the function is overridden, having different behaviors depending on the derived class passed, such function can be resolved to the appropriate behavior by use of the arrow operator, allowing the function to access the member of the matching derived class type passed. A pointer to a base class assigned the address of a derived class may be used in such scenarios in conjunction with the arrow operator and overridden functions. This is known as downcasting.
